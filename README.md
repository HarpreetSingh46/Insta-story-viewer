# Insta-story-viewer
This project is a simple Instagram Stories clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays circular story icons that open full-screen images when clicked. The design uses flexbox for centering, scrollable story bars, and dynamic JS rendering for an interactive, app-like experience.
